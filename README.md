# Elastic-Stack-Train

Here I'll be Learning How to Use Elastic Stack with Docker containers

## To Remember

- If you didn't create a directory structure `elastic/data` then run this `sudo chown -R 1000:1000 elastic` otherwise the elasticsearch container will fail.
  - let the container run creating the `elastic/data` structure then
  - run `sudo chown -R 1000:1000 elastic`
